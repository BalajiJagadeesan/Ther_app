## Features:
The application can be accessed only if the user is a valid member (enrolled in the system). This can be possible by enabling user authentication even before accessing the core functionality of the database. If the user tries to log in with the wrong password 5 or more times, the system will lock down and the user cannot access his account for some time.
 If the user logins in successfully, he/she can access the functionality of the application. The user has couple of options to do now.
*	Search for friends: The user can search for other friends enrolled in the system by typing their name.(By default the application shows the list of members enrolled in the system)
*	Add a friend to their list: The user can request his friend to add their account to their list, if accepted the details of their friend are added to the user personalized list.
*	Locate friend: The user can open their personalized list and track the location of the members from that list.
*	Change privacy control: The user have the ability to hide their location to members (for a predefined amount of time say 1 hour or so).
*	Cross platform compatible: No matter what platform the user or his/her friends is using, all of them can able to share and track others if they have necessary permission(should be approved by the userâ€™s friends to track them)
